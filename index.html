								<b>The Formation of Eccentric Nuclear Disks from Gravitational Wave Recoil Kicks</b><br>
								The closest massive galactic neighbor, Andromeda, hosts a supermassive black hole that is
								surrounded by a lopsided, eccentric disk of stars. The merger of galaxies and the
								subsequent merger of the central supermassive black holes may be key in explaining the
								formation of these asymmetric stellar disks. The anisotropic emission of gravitational
								waves during the merger of two supermassive black holes causes a recoil kick to be imparted
								on the merger remnant. We showed in this
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921L..12A">2021 letter</a> that
								eccentric stellars disks with stars on apse-aligned orbits can directly form as a result
								of the kick. Eccentric disks are able to enhance the rate of tidal disruption events,
								where stars become torn apart by the black hole due to strong tidal gravity. The rate can
								be 3 or 4 orders of magnitude higher in a lopsided disk compared to a symmetric one! This
								work was most recently presented at the
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022HEAD...1920605A">HEAD</a> and
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022DDA....5340404A">DDA</a> meetings in 2022.
								This project was carried out with 
								<a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~madigan/">Dr. Ann-Marie Madigan</a>.
