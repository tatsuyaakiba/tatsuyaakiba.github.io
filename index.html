								<b>The Formation of Eccentric Nuclear Disks from Gravitational Wave Recoil Kicks</b><br>
								The closest massive galactic neighbor, Andromeda, hosts a supermassive black hole that is
								surrounded by a lopsided, eccentric disk of stars. The merger of galaxies and the
								subsequent merger of the central supermassive black holes may be key in explaining the
								formation of these asymmetric stellar disks. The anisotropic emission of gravitational
								waves during the merger of two supermassive black holes causes a recoil kick to be imparted
								on the merger remnant. We showed in this
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921L..12A">2021 letter</a> that
								eccentric stellars disks with stars on apse-aligned orbits can directly form as a result
								of such a kick. We further showed in this
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...958..137A">2023 paper</a>
								that the surrounding star cluster following a recoil kick exhibits unique density
								and velocity structures that may be used to observationally detect recoiling supermassive
								black holes. Eccentric disks are able to enhance the rate of tidal disruption events, where
								stars become torn apart by the black hole due to strong tidal gravity. The rate can be 3 or
								4 orders of magnitude higher in a lopsided disk compared to a symmetric one! This enhanced
								tidal disruption rate is indeed observed in merging/post-merger galaxies. This project is
								being carried out with my primary advisor
								<a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~madigan/">Dr. Ann-Marie Madigan</a>. See the
								<a href="#bhdynamics">Black Hole Dynamics</a> page for more details!

								<b>Evidence of a Recent Merger in the Galactic Center/b><br>
								We have applied the same mechanism of forming an eccentric disk via a
								gravitational wave recoil kick to explain the peculiar structure of the Milky Way
								Galactic Center. In the Galactic Center, there is a coherent disk of young stars
								between 0.05 and 0.5 pc, and the S-stars which are even closer in at < 0.04 pc are highly
								eccentric with a nearly isotropic distribution in inclination. We will show in a 2024 letter
								(in prep) that a low eccentricity, apse-aligned disk evolves to reproduce much of the
								eccentricity and inclination distributions of the S-star cluster and the surrounding
								disk within a few Myr suggesting a recent merger between an intermediate-mass black
								hole and Sagittarius A*. This research project is being conducted in collaboration with
								<a href="https://www.astro.ucla.edu/~snaoz/">Dr. Smadar Naoz</a> at UCLA. See the
								<a href="#gcdynamics">Galactic Center Dynamics</a> page for more details!
							</p> 
							<p>
								<b>White Dwarf Pollution from Natal Kicks</b><br>
								Many astrophysical bodies receive kicks, so the above dynamics are relevant for other
								contexts. A white dwarf receives a natal kick during its birth due to anisotropic
								mass loss during the asymptotic giant branch. As a result, an eccentric disk of planetesimals
								should surround the white dwarf after the kick. The eccentric debris disk can then
								efficiently throw planetesimals toward the white dwarf and increase the rate of
								planetesimal tidal disruption events. This mechanism can explain the abundance of
								polluted white dwarfs, white dwarfs with unexpectedly high amounts of heavy metals on
								their surface. This work will be presented in a 2024 letter (submitted).
								This project is being worked on with
								<a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~madigan/">Dr. Ann-Marie Madigan</a> and assisted by an
								CU undergraduate student, Selah McIntyre. See the
								<a href="#wddynamics">White Dwarf Dynamics</a> page for more details!

								<b>Reprocessing Models for Hypervariable Quasars</b><br>
								Quasars are extremely luminous active galactic nuclei, supermassive black holes which are
								actively feeding on their surrounding accretion disks. While standard accretion disk theory
								suggests that significant changes in the brightness of a quasar should take longer than ten
								thousand years, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has discovered quasars that change in
								luminosity by up to factors of ~10 on much shorter timescales of months to years. These
								hypervariable quasars challenge our theories of accretion around supermassive black holes.
								One of the theories that can explain the hypervariable behavior is thermal reprocessing:
								the X-ray or extreme UV light from the quasar inner environment could be shining on an
								accretion structure that absorbs and re-emits the light at longer wavelengths. This can
								explain the large-amplitude, correlated variability we observe in the optical light curves
								of hypervariable quasars. We showed in a
								<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...953..124A">2023 paper</a> that the
								optical light curves of most of the hypervariable quasars observed by SDSS can be explained
								by thermal reprocessing in a thick accretion structure (rather than a thin disk). The
								standard thin disk is heavily disfavored by our model, and our work presented a first-order
								classification scheme for uncovering the likely reprocessing geometries of hypervariable
								quasars. This project was advised by 
								<a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/~jdexter/">Dr. Jason Dexter</a>. See the
								<a href="#quasars">Hypervariable Quasars</a> page for more details!

								diverse graduate cohort, and we recently put together a diversity, equity, and inclusion
								(DEI) strategic plan for the department. I am currently the Lead Graduate Fellow, a liaison
								between the astrophysics community and the Center for Teaching and Learning. Through this
								role, I have been able to share many teaching resources that are cognizant of equity and
								inclusion with the department's instructors, teaching assistants, and learning assistants.
								I am currently writing a DEI teaching manual for the astrophysics department. In addition,
								I have supported the retention of students by serving as a mentor for the CU-Prime,
								Graduate Peer Mentoring, and McNair programs where participants often belong to
								under-represented minority groups and/or are first-generation college students.
